# Brakeknights Project

## Overview
Website and customer portal for Brakeknights (brakeknights.com).
Built with Node.js/Express, deployed on Hostinger.

## Key Facts
- Live site at **brakeknights.com** was built using **Hostinger's website builder** — not code-based
- The GitHub repo is a new code-based version being developed separately
- Live site must never be broken — always preview on dev first

## Branch & Deployment Workflow
- `dev` branch → auto-deploys to **dev.brakeknights.com** (sandbox/preview)
- `master` branch → auto-deploys to **brakeknights.com** (live site)
- All changes go on `dev` first. Only merge to `master` when the user approves.
- Never push directly to `master` without explicit user approval.

## Hostinger MCP
A Hostinger MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json`.
It allows direct management of Hostinger hosting from Claude Code.
The API token is entered securely at session start — never hardcode it.

## Project Structure
- `server.js` — Express server, reads PORT from environment
- `public/index.html` — frontend HTML
- `package.json` + `package-lock.json` — Node.js dependencies

## Screenshots with Playwright
- Always use `element.offsetTop` to scroll to a section — never `getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY` (that value changes as the page scrolls and will land on the wrong section)
- Always use `offsetTop` pattern: `const y = await page.evaluate(() => document.querySelector('#section-id').offsetTop); await page.evaluate((y) => window.scrollTo(0, y), y);`
- Never merge to `dev` without explicit user approval — commit and push to the feature branch only

## Dev Workflow Rules — ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE
⛔ STOP. READ THIS BEFORE EVERY PUSH. NO EXCEPTIONS. EVER.

1. ALL changes go to the feature branch ONLY (`claude/dreamy-noether-W8Mwi`)
2. After making changes: take a screenshot, show the user, then STOP and WAIT
3. Do NOT merge to `dev` until the user explicitly says "push to dev" or "approved"
4. Do NOT merge to `master` under any circumstances without explicit user approval
5. "I won't do it again" is not enough — CHECK THIS LIST before every single merge

THE WORKFLOW IS:
  feature branch → show screenshot → WAIT FOR APPROVAL → then merge to dev
  dev → WAIT FOR APPROVAL → then merge to master

There is NO shortcut. There is NO exception. Not even "just a small fix."
- Current feature branch: `claude/stoic-maxwell-n9CYe`

## Current Work in Progress
Update this section at the end of each session to stay caught up next time.

- Working branch: `claude/stoic-maxwell-n9CYe`
- Next steps:
  1. Hero badge: Option B (solid gold bg, navy text) is committed but not approved — user needs to pick Option A (dark backdrop, gold text) or Option B
  2. Van photo for hero: user wants to use it but couldn't share via iCloud. Ask them to try Imgur (imgur.com → upload → copy direct link) next session
  3. Fix About page on mobile: background photo too large, font too large and blurry
  4. Feature branch ready for review → merge to dev → then master

## Master To-Do List
⚠️ This is the single source of truth. Update it every time an item is completed or added.

### Immediate Action Required (User)
- [ ] Set `SMTP_PASS` environment variable in Hostinger hPanel → Hosting → Manage → Node.js → Environment Variables (value = greetings@brakeknights.com email password)

### Quick Fixes
- [ ] Fix stale links: `/brake-repair-fairfax` → `/brake-repair-fairfax-city` on 8 pages (Vienna, Centreville, Burke, Springfield, Merrifield, Fairfax Station, Clifton, Location page)
- [ ] Fix broken links to deleted pages — Springfield & Alexandria pages link to `/brake-repair-lorton`; Manassas links to `/brake-repair-dale-city`
- [ ] Fix Services page footer — missing `mailto:` link on email address

### Decisions Needed
- [ ] Hero badge style — Option A (dark backdrop, gold text) or Option B (solid gold bg, navy text)? Option B is currently on the feature branch
- [ ] Van photo — need a hosted image URL to add to homepage hero
- [ ] About page mobile fix — background photo too large, text blurry and too large on mobile

### Bigger Builds
- [ ] Automated customer confirmation email — branded reply sent to customer on form submission (confirm receipt, booking details)
- [ ] Automated quote system — vehicle tier pricing, auto-stop rules, quote delivery via email (tabled — pricing structure discussion ready to resume)
- [ ] Homepage hero CTA redesign — user has specific vision; discuss before building
- [ ] Upload 5 phone photos and add to the site

### Branch & Deployment
- [ ] Approve feature branch (`claude/stoic-maxwell-n9CYe`) → merge to dev → then master
