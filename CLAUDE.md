# Brakeknights Project

## Overview
Website and customer portal for Brakeknights (brakeknights.com).
Built with Node.js/Express, deployed on Hostinger.

## Key Facts
- Live site at **brakeknights.com** was built using **Hostinger's website builder** — not code-based
- The GitHub repo is a new code-based version being developed separately
- Live site must never be broken — always preview on dev first

## Branch & Deployment Workflow
- `dev` branch → **auto-deploys to dev.brakeknights.com** via Hostinger git integration (Branch: dev, Node 22) — just push to `dev` and it deploys automatically
- `master` branch → deploys to **brakeknights.com** (live site)
- All changes go on feature branch first. Only merge to `dev` when user approves. Only merge to `master` when user approves.
- Never push directly to `master` without explicit user approval.
- **Deployment note:** Hostinger git auto-deploy is configured to watch the `dev` branch. Pushing to `dev` triggers deployment. Archive uploads also work but git push is simpler. SMTP_PASS env var is already set in Hostinger for dev.brakeknights.com.

## Hostinger MCP
A Hostinger MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json`.
It allows direct management of Hostinger hosting from Claude Code.
The API token is entered securely at session start — never hardcode it.

## Project Structure
- `server.js` — Express server, reads PORT from environment
- `public/index.html` — frontend HTML
- `package.json` + `package-lock.json` — Node.js dependencies

## Screenshots with Playwright
- Always use `element.offsetTop` to scroll to a section — never `getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY` (that value changes as the page scrolls and will land on the wrong section)
- Always use `offsetTop` pattern: `const y = await page.evaluate(() => document.querySelector('#section-id').offsetTop); await page.evaluate((y) => window.scrollTo(0, y), y);`
- Never merge to `dev` without explicit user approval — commit and push to the feature branch only

## Dev Workflow Rules — ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE
⛔ STOP. READ THIS BEFORE EVERY PUSH. NO EXCEPTIONS. EVER.

1. ALL changes go to the feature branch ONLY
2. After making changes: take a screenshot, show the user, then STOP and WAIT
3. Do NOT merge to `dev` until the user explicitly says "push to dev" or "merge to dev" or "approved for dev"
4. Do NOT merge to `master` under any circumstances without explicit user approval
5. "I won't do it again" is not enough — CHECK THIS LIST before every single merge
6. ⛔ NEVER auto-merge to dev after a fix, even if it seems small or obvious

THE WORKFLOW IS:
  feature branch → show screenshot → WAIT FOR APPROVAL → then merge to dev
  dev → WAIT FOR APPROVAL → then merge to master

There is NO shortcut. There is NO exception. Not even "just a small fix."
ASKING "should I push to dev?" IS NOT ENOUGH — wait for the user to say it.
- Current feature branch: `claude/pensive-bell-ssjun`

## Hook-Enforced Branch Guard
A PreToolUse hook at `.claude/hooks/guard-dev-master.sh` HARD-BLOCKS any
`git commit`, `git merge`, or `git push` targeting `dev` or `master`.
This is enforced by Claude Code — Claude cannot bypass it.

To approve a dev push: type **"go dev"** in your message. A UserPromptSubmit
hook at `.claude/hooks/approve-dev-push.sh` writes a one-shot token that
the guard consumes on the next dev-targeted git operation. The token is
deleted after one use.

- Scope: dev only. Master is NEVER bypassable by token — always requires
  the user to run the git command themselves.
- Lifetime: one-shot. Each "go dev" approves exactly one operation.
- `git push --all` / `--mirror` are blocked unconditionally.

## Current Work in Progress
Update this section at the end of each session to stay caught up next time.

- Working branch: `claude/pensive-bell-ssjun`
- `dev` branch is live at dev.brakeknights.com — auto-deploys on every push to `dev` ✅
- Form emails fully working: internal notification + customer confirmation ✅
- iOS "Allow Phone" dialog fix shipped: format-detection meta on all 45 pages,
  E.164 tel: links, Google Maps iframes converted to click-to-load on
  index.html and contact.html (Maps was holding session-level tel: permission state) ✅
- Branch guard system live: hard hook blocks dev/master ops; "go dev"
  keyword grants one-shot dev approval ✅
- Next steps:
  1. Verify on real iPhone that the "Allow Phone" dialog no longer appears
  2. Upload 5 phone photos and add to site
  3. Once all approved → merge to master

## To-Do List
⚠️ Single source of truth. Update every time an item is completed or added.

### Pending
- [ ] Verify on real iPhone: "Allow Phone" dialog no longer appears (test header, hero, footer, bare phone numbers across multiple pages)
- [ ] Upload 5 phone photos and add to the site
- [ ] Automated quote system — vehicle tier pricing, auto-stop rules, quote delivery via email (tabled — pricing structure discussion ready to resume)

### Completed This Session
- [x] iOS "Allow Phone" dialog fix — three layers: format-detection meta on all 45 pages, all 229 tel: links upgraded to E.164 (`tel:+17039774475`), bare phone number text wrapped in proper tel: anchors on 5 pages
