# Brakeknights Project

## Session Startup Checklist (Run These First, Every Session)
1. `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` — activates the master push block
2. `git branch --show-current` — confirm you are on `claude/gallant-ptolemy-9gZLb` (or the current feature branch); if not, switch: `git checkout claude/gallant-ptolemy-9gZLb`

## Master Push Override
The pre-push hook blocks all pushes to master by default.
To override: user says **"go master"** in chat. Claude then runs the push with `MASTER_OVERRIDE="go master"` set as an env var.

⛔ **`MASTER_OVERRIDE` is the USER'S keyword to give — NEVER set it unless the user typed "go master" in this chat turn. No exceptions. Not for urgent fixes. Not for hotfixes. Not for "it's already on dev." Ask first, always.**

## Skill/Tooling Push Override
For changes that are dev tooling only (skills, hooks, scripts — nothing that affects the live site):
User says **"go skill"** in chat. Claude merges the feature branch to BOTH `dev` and `master` in one operation, using `MASTER_OVERRIDE="go skill"`.
No dev preview needed for tooling-only changes.

## Overview
Website and customer portal for Brakeknights (brakeknights.com).
Built with Node.js/Express, deployed on Hostinger.

## Key Facts
- **brakeknights.com is now the code-based Node.js/Express site** — deployed from the `master` branch via Hostinger git auto-deploy
- The old Hostinger website builder site was replaced during launch
- Live site must never be broken — always preview on dev first

## Branch & Deployment Workflow
- `dev` branch → **auto-deploys to dev.brakeknights.com** via Hostinger git integration (Branch: dev, Node 22) — just push to `dev` and it deploys automatically
- `master` branch → deploys to **brakeknights.com** (live site)
- All changes go on feature branch first. Only merge to `dev` when user approves. Only merge to `master` when user approves.
- Never push directly to `master` without explicit user approval.
- **Deployment note:** Both `dev` and `master` branches are configured for Hostinger git auto-deploy. Pushing triggers automatic deployment. SMTP_PASS env var is set in Hostinger for both dev.brakeknights.com and brakeknights.com.

## Hostinger MCP
A Hostinger MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json`.
It allows direct management of Hostinger hosting from Claude Code.
The API token is entered securely at session start — never hardcode it.

## Project Structure
- `server.js` — Express server, reads PORT from environment
- `public/index.html` — frontend HTML
- `package.json` + `package-lock.json` — Node.js dependencies

## Writing & Punctuation Rules
- No em dashes (—) unless grammatically required (e.g., true parenthetical aside). Use a colon for introducing lists/explanations, a comma for brief pauses, or rewrite the sentence. This applies to all copy: HTML, emails, CLAUDE.md, everywhere.

## Screenshots with Playwright
- Always use `element.offsetTop` to scroll to a section — never `getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY` (that value changes as the page scrolls and will land on the wrong section)
- Always use `offsetTop` pattern: `const y = await page.evaluate(() => document.querySelector('#section-id').offsetTop); await page.evaluate((y) => window.scrollTo(0, y), y);`
- Never merge to `dev` without explicit user approval — commit and push to the feature branch only

## Dev Workflow Rules — ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE
⛔ STOP. READ THIS BEFORE EVERY PUSH. NO EXCEPTIONS. EVER.

1. ALL changes go to the feature branch ONLY
2. After making changes: take a screenshot, show the user, then STOP and WAIT
3. Do NOT merge to `dev` until the user explicitly says "push to dev" or "merge to dev" or "go dev"
4. Do NOT merge to `master` under ANY circumstances without the user typing **"go master"** in chat
5. "I won't do it again" is not enough — CHECK THIS LIST before every single merge
6. ⛔ NEVER auto-merge to dev after a fix, even if it seems small or obvious
7. ⛔ NEVER merge to master after a "go dev" — "go dev" means dev ONLY, full stop
8. ⛔ NEVER decide master is safe to push to because "it's urgent" or "it's already on dev" — ALWAYS wait for "go master"

THE WORKFLOW IS:
  feature branch → show screenshot → WAIT → user says "go dev" → merge to dev ONLY → STOP
  WAIT → user says "go master" → merge to master

There is NO shortcut. There is NO exception. Not even "just a small fix." Not even a hotfix.
"go dev" ≠ "go master". They are separate approvals. Always.
- Current feature branch: `claude/compassionate-bardeen-pgOcq`

## Square Integration — Platform Build Plan

The long-term vision is a fully owned Brake Knights business platform. Square is used only as the payment processor and appointment calendar backend. All customer communication (quotes, confirmations, receipts, follow-ups) flows through our own system. Eventually white-labeled and sold to other service businesses.

### Architecture Decision
- Admin tools live at `brakeknights.com/admin` (password-protected, same server as public site)
- Square handles: payment processing, appointment calendar, sales reporting
- Our system handles: all customer-facing emails, CRM, quotes, job summaries, follow-up automation

### Square Env Vars (set in Hostinger hPanel for brakeknights.com)
- `SQUARE_APP_ID` — production app ID
- `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` — production access token
- `SQUARE_SANDBOX_APP_ID` — sandbox app ID
- `SQUARE_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` — sandbox access token
- Connection verified: `brakeknights.com/api/square/verify` returns `{"environment":"production","customers":"ok","bookings":"ok"}`

### Square Module
- `square.js` — initializes SquareClient from env vars, exports `client` and `verifyConnection()`
- Defaults to production when `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is present and `SQUARE_ENV` is not `sandbox`

### Platform Build Phases

**Phase 2 (current — in progress):** When a customer submits the contact form, automatically create or find them as a Square customer. Foundation of the CRM.

**Phase 3:** Quote tool — owner enters service + price + proposed time, system sends a branded quote email to the customer.

**Phase 4:** Booking confirmation — once price/time agreed, owner books in Square, our system sends a full branded confirmation email: service, price, date, time, address.

**Phase 5:** Job summary + custom receipt — after payment, owner triggers a branded receipt with a proper Technician Notes section (Square's native receipt has no custom notes section).

**Phase 6:** Follow-up automation — notes entered on the job summary trigger timed reminder emails to owner and customer (e.g. "rear brakes have 6 months left" → reminder email sent at that time).

**Phase 7:** Full CRM dashboard at `brakeknights.com/admin` — customer profiles, vehicle history, job history, upcoming follow-ups, all owned by Brake Knights.

**Phase 8:** Automated quotes — instant quote emails based on vehicle type and service selected (requires pricing table to be finalized first).

**Phase 9:** White-label packaging — multi-tenant architecture, per-brand configuration, reseller infrastructure for other service businesses.

### Current Customer Flow (for context)
- Customer calls/texts → verbal price + schedule discussion → owner books in Square → Square sends confirmation (date/time only, no price)
- Customer submits form → owner replies by email with price → customer confirms → owner books in Square → Square sends confirmation (date/time only, no price)
- Payment: credit card via Square POS app on phone; cash/Zelle recorded manually in Square for sales tracking

## Current Work in Progress
Update this section at the end of each session to stay caught up next time.

- "go skill" keyword added — pushes tooling-only changes to both dev and master in one shot ✅
- Session startup hook shows pending dev-vs-master commits at session start ✅
- Screenshot skill in place — `node scripts/screenshot.js [path] [selector]` ✅
- Playwright Chromium installed by session hook — no mid-task download delays ✅
